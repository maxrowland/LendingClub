# LendingClub
Peer to peer lending is a relatively new entrant to the banking industry. It works quite simply. Instead of a bank lending you money you borrow from people just like yourself. Platforms like Prosper and LendingClub help connect lenders and borrowers for a small fee.

To help lenders evaluate loans on their platform LendingClub has made available: data on each loan ever funded, along with time series data of payments and key characteristics on the borrower. This data-set contains items you would expect; such as income, debt-to-income ratio, and FICO scores. It also contains whether the loan has defaulted or not, this is the single most important piece of information as a lender. Since these are unsecured loans, your return will be largely dependent on avoiding loans that default. LendingClub is underwriting each loan before it gets onto the platform, but loans still default after being funded.

This project will be making use of the following data sets:

LendingClub loan stats (2007 - Q1 2020)
LendingClub payment history (2007 - 2020)
This repo holds all scripts, both MySQL and Python used in developing models to try and predict loan defaults with the LendingClub data set.
